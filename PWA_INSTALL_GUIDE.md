## Installing on Android

3. Click it and select **"Install"**
4. The app opens in its own window

### Safari (Mac):
- Unfortunately, Safari on macOS doesn't support PWA installation
- Use Chrome or Edge instead

## Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" option missing?
- Make sure you're using **Safari** on iOS (not Chrome or Firefox)
- The option only appears in Safari's share menu

### App not working offline?
- Open the app at least once while online
- The service worker needs to cache resources first
- After that, it works completely offline!

### Icon not showing up?
- The icon might take a moment to generate
- Try restarting your iPad if it doesn't appear

### Want to uninstall?
- Long-press the app icon on home screen
- Tap "Remove App" → "Delete App"
- Your data will remain in Safari until you clear browser data
